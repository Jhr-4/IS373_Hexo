**Docker** is a tool that performs containerization, allowing a user to easily run and manage many containers. It helps avoid conflicts from different OS or enviorments while running a program. 

### Key Terms:

* **Container:** A lightweight environment that holds the program code and files. 
    * It runs on the host computer using its kernel which manages the hardware (cpu, memory, etc) and bridges it to the software. This is one benifit of a container as it makes it lightweight. You don't need to install a whole VM. (more discussed in the next page).
    * This also makes it isolated meaning it can't touch anything outside of itself. 

* **Docker Image:** A template that has everything the program needs from code to the dependencies it uses. 
    * This image is created from a dockerfile that holds instructions on how to set it up and says what dependencies to install
    * Additionally, this image is the part that is shared to allow others to use or work on the the program. 


## I. Learn more about why you would use Dockers containerization over just a virtual machine:

## II. Don't other containerization softwares like Kubernetes exist? Why use Docker over them?
